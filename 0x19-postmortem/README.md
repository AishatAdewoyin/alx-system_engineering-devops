**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage on November 10, 2023**

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** November 10, 2023, 14:00 - 18:30 (UTC)
- **Impact:** Users experienced a complete service outage, affecting 80% of our user base. The web application was inaccessible, leading to a loss of user engagement and potential revenue.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing an inability to distribute incoming traffic to the application servers effectively.

**Timeline:**
- **13:45 (UTC):** Issue detected through a spike in error rates on the monitoring dashboard.
- **13:50 (UTC):** Automated alerts triggered for high latency and increased error rates.
- **14:00 (UTC):** Investigation initiated by the operations team.
- **14:15 (UTC):** Assumed database overload as the root cause, leading to a deep dive into database performance.
- **15:00 (UTC):** Database team engaged to address the perceived issue.
- **16:30 (UTC):** No improvement observed; suspicion shifted to network issues.
- **17:00 (UTC):** Network team brought in for investigation.
- **17:45 (UTC):** Realized load balancer misconfiguration as the actual cause.
- **18:00 (UTC):** Load balancer settings corrected.
- **18:30 (UTC):** Full service restoration; monitoring confirmed normalized error rates.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Root Cause:** The load balancer was misconfigured to distribute traffic unevenly, causing a bottleneck in the application servers, leading to increased latency and eventual service outage.
- **Resolution:** Load balancer settings were corrected to evenly distribute incoming traffic among application servers. This immediately alleviated the strain on the servers and restored normal functionality.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - **Load Balancer Configuration Review:** Regularly review and audit load balancer configurations to ensure they align with the application's needs.
  - **Enhanced Monitoring:** Implement additional monitoring checks specifically targeting load balancer performance and configuration to catch anomalies early.
  - **Automated Alerts:** Set up alerts for load balancer misconfigurations and irregularities to expedite future issue identification.

- **Tasks:**
  - **Documentation Update:** Enhance documentation on load balancer configuration best practices.
  - **Training Session:** Conduct a training session for operations and network teams on identifying and troubleshooting load balancer issues.
  - **Post-Incident Review:** Schedule a post-incident review meeting to analyze the response process, identify areas for improvement, and share key learnings across teams.
  
This outage served as a crucial learning experience, emphasizing the importance of systematic troubleshooting and cross-team collaboration. Moving forward, we commit to implementing the outlined corrective and preventative measures to fortify our infrastructure and enhance our incident response capabilities.
